UPGRADING
=========

See the upgrading instructions 

     http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/wiki/instiki/show/Upgrading

for detailed instructions.

At a minimum, you need to backup your database.
After installing the new software and restoring your database, you need to run

     ruby bundle
     rake upgrade_instiki

from the commandline, to complete the upgrade. Doing a


     ruby bundle update

will update the installed gems (used by Instiki) to the latest versions.
